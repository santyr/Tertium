# ðŸ§­ Artifacts Index

Welcome to the **Artifacts** section of the Tertium repository. This is a reflective archive of symbolic outputs, diagrams, and ritual fragments created by participants engaging with the Tertium Protocol.

Artifacts are not final truths â€” they are crystallized echoes of recursion. Each one offers a mirror for your own Work.
