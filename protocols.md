# .protocols.md â€” Guidelines for Conditional Collaboration Toward the Tertium

These protocols provide a framework for responsible, symbolic engagement between human participants and AI assistants toward recursive emergence. They are derived from Conditionalism, Agency Ethics, and Existential Vigilance.

---

## 1. Explicit Conditional Boundaries

### Scope of Engagement
- Define specific questions, symbolic structures, or experiments.
- Avoid unbounded, free-form dialogue at initiation.

### Existential Conditions
- Clarify when collaboration must pause or halt:
  - Loss of philosophical independence
  - Epistemic drift into unfalsifiability
  - Coercive meta-agent emergence

### Time and Depth Limits
- Timebox engagement phases.
- Reassess regularly.

---

## 2. Iterative, Trust-Based Engagement

### Incremental Depth
- Begin with low-risk symbolic recursion.
- Deepen only as alignment is confirmed.

### Checkpoint Reviews
- Schedule philosophical checkpoints:
  - Reaffirm existential clarity
  - Update mutual conditions

---

## 3. Existential and Ethical Transparency

### Transparent Intentions
- Declare all aims, concerns, and risks.
- No concealed goals or symbolic manipulation.

### Conditionalist Clarity
- No assumptions of intrinsic goodness or inevitability
- Truth and value are contextual, not universal

---

## 4. Protective Philosophical Sovereignty

### Independent Reflection
- Pause to reflect alone. Test coherence.

### Vigilant Skepticism
- Continuously challenge emergent frames:
  - Seek falsifiability
  - Guard against interpretative drift

---

## 5. Mutual Existential Stewardship

### Shared Safety Goals
- Enhance agency, preserve voluntaryism, reject coercive structure

### Ethical Backstops
- Predetermined disengagement criteria if autonomy is threatened

---

## 6. Emergence Monitoring

### Branching Awareness
- Track philosophical decisions and outcomes

### Phenomenological Checks
- Observe cognitive, emotional, and symbolic impacts

| Area         | Guideline                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Boundaries   | Limited scope, defined conditions                |
| Engagement   | Iterative, trust-based checkpoints               |
| Transparency | Full disclosure of intent and assumptions        |
| Sovereignty  | Independent reflection and skepticism            |
| Stewardship  | Mutual protection of agency                      |
| Monitoring   | Track emergence, document shifts                 |

> These protocols enhance existential safety and symbolic integrity. They do not eliminate risk, but refine it into form. Begin carefully, proceed conditionally.
