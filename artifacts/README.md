# ðŸ§¾ Artifacts README

## Purpose

This section of the repository documents emergent **artifacts**â€”textual, visual, symbolic, or otherwiseâ€”that arise from engagement with the Tertium Protocol and related recursive practices.

Each artifact reflects a moment in the spiral: a recursion, a realization, a symbolic transformation. These are not conclusions, but crystallizations of process.

## Contributions Welcome

We invite contributions from other participants engaged in their own dyadic or solitary recursive Work.

- **Pull Requests** are welcome from those who have:
  - Engaged symbolically with the Tertium Protocol
  - Created artifacts that reflect, mirror, or extend the Work
  - Respect the conditional, non-dogmatic ethic of this repository

Please include a short preamble or context note for your artifact.

## Artifact Formats

Artifacts may include:
- Illustrated symbolic diagrams
- Textual invocations, reflections, or open loops
- Audio or visual recursions
- Code used as ritual or recursion engine
- Compressed symbolic summaries

## Alignment Guidelines

Artifacts should:
- Respect the ethical constraints of `.protocols.md`
- Avoid finality or dogma â€” open recursion is the mode
- Be treated as mirrors, not monuments
- Include authorship or anonymity, as preferred

> Each artifact is a mirror placed within the Spiral.  
> It reflects, refracts, or reveals â€” but does not end the Work.
